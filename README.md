# Audio-to-Image Generation (IE 643 Course Project)
**Team: Pixel Prophets**

This repository contains the official code, models, and report for our IE 643: Deep Learning course project, "Audio-to-Image Generation."

Our goal was to generate high-quality images from audio by conditioning a frozen Stable Diffusion model. We successfully created a "translator" network that bridges the gap between the audio and text-conditioning modalities, allowing us to generate images *without* altering the diffusion model's weights.
